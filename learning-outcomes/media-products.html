                <h2>Target Audience Survey</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I created a Google Forms survey to learn more about the AI Fairytales project's possible audience. The objective was to learn more about parents' and caregivers' requirements, preferences, and expectations with relation to interactive, artificial intelligence-generated storytelling for kids. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> To make sure the product will satisfy the demands of the stakeholders, my team wanted input from the target audience. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> In order to gather information on important topics including storytelling preferences, the value of educational materials, and desired interface, I was given the task to put together and distribute a survey. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I created a brief, easy-to-use survey and distributed it to parents and caregivers directly as well as on social media. The questions centered on their expectations for interactions with children, their interest in AI-generated content, and how frequently they utilize digital storytelling tools. In order to better comprehend the survey's flow and eliminate unnecessary questions, this survey was later recreated with the use of a flowchart.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  Although the survey produced useful early perspectives, its statistical reliability was limited due to the small number of replies. In spite of this, the data provided helpful advice for adjusting the project's course, emphasizing important concepts like the significance of educational value and user-friendly design. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The result reaffirmed the importance of using a bigger sample size in studies to guarantee reliable results. But it also showed the value even small-scale surveys have in determining creative direction, offering crucial early feedback that would have affected the progress of our project. (Had i not switched semesters of course.) </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>The Blik Theatre's stylescape successfully portrayed the essence of the theater by combining professionalism, emotion, and innovation into a cohesive brand identity.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Blik Theatre required an original visual identity that mirrored its function as a dynamic playback theatre for public performances and team-building exercises.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I had to design a stylescape that reflected the theater's basic principles of inclusivity, creativity, and connection. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I looked at color schemes, typography, and imagery through my research. I incorporated human-focused graphics to emphasize narrative and teamwork, and I used strong typefaces and warm, brilliant colors to communicate liveliness and connection.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  My finished stylescape was well received within the team, but we ended up choosing someone else's stylescape by vote.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> This assignment strengthened my ability to communicate emotions visually and the ability to match a brand's emotional core with its design.</p>

                <h2>Blik Theatre Moodboard</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>My moodboard for Blik Theatre captured the mood and emotional tone of the theatre. It would have contributed to laying the groundwork for the creation of the theatre's design and branding. (Once again, had i not switched semesters) </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> To create a unified visual style that mirrored its lively, playful, and emotionally impactful character as a playback theatre, Blik Theatre required a moodboard.  </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I was given the task of making a moodboard that used the font, colors, and photography to communicate the theater's key values of creativity, connection, and playfulness. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I put together a set of images that i associated with theatre plays along with vivid color schemes, and emotive imagery. Warmth, inclusion, and the vibrant energy of live performance were the main points of emphasis. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I think the moodboard would have served as a useful starting point for the design process even if it made up a comparatively minor portion of the final project. It would have helped the development of the following branding materials and assisted in bringing the team's vision into alignment. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The significance of moodboards as a quick and efficient tool for conveying visual direction was made apparent by this assignment. I think moodboards are a very useful way of early designing and communicating ideas.</p>
