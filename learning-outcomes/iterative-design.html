                <h2>Logo Patched Studio</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>One of the most important steps in building our brand identity was designing the Patched Studio logo. Because we worked together, everyone was able to submit original ideas, which resulted in a thoughtful and vast design process.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Our studio, Patched Studio, required a logo. We made the decision to work as a team, and each member came up with early logo suggestions that we all reviewed. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> In order to creatively and visually portray the core values of Patched Studio, I was tasked with coming up with a couple logo options that included our studio's initials.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I started with paper drawings, experimenting with several logo concepts centered around the initials "P" and "S." I used Adobe Illustrator to polish the sketches that my peers and I liked the best after getting their input. I eventually settled on a circular shape and continued to refine it to create a simple, unified logo.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  The team responded positively to my final design when I presented it to them. My logo was praised for its creative interpretation of initial-based logos and provided important inspiration for the final choice, even though we ultimately decided on a different team member's design.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The value of teamwork and design iteration was showcased with this task. It emphasized that the process and feedback may have a big impact on the end product and improve teamwork even if a design is not chosen.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes Concept AI Fairytales</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>This task demonstrates my design studio's teamwork in creating a concept for an interactive WebApp that provides customized bedtime stories. By offering customizable, educational, and child-friendly stories, the app sought to assist parents, caretakers, and teachers as a primary target audience. I thought of the focuspoints on modification and archiving, also i created the wireframe design to make the concept a reality, even though the client supplied all the necessary specifications. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> The client requested a concept that utilized their API for AI storytelling, since parents have trouble finding personalized, interesting bedtime stories, also having to keep buying books for your children is very expensive nowadays. After receiving a list of criteria, my team came up with extra areas of focus to improve the project.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> I was in charge of making wireframes, focusing in on important aspects like archiving and personalization, and making sure the idea matched the requirements of the client and the user experience.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Worked together with the group to identify important areas of focus, such as personalization and accessibility.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created wireframes that detailed the user experience, including story creating, archiving, and login.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created extensive customization choices for story components such as themes, settings, and characters.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Suggested an archiving mechanism to preserve characters and stories while supporting continuity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  After showing my team and teachers the wireframes my additions were positively recognized, pointing out the app's accessibility and user-friendly design, especially in the areas of customization and archiving. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of communication within the team, and user-centered design was shown in this part of the project. I'm sure that if i was still part of this semester I could've created a superb product, unfortunately I will never know seeing as i got moved back to the previous semester.</p>

                <h2>Wireframes Fix That UX</h2>
                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>I made wireframes that targeted important UX pain points for ZEKUR, a Dutch health insurance firm, in order to enhance their user experience. Because I entered the project late, it needed to be completed quickly, but I was still able to make significant changes that the client was pleased with.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> I was given the task to assess the user experience of Zilveren Kruis, CZ, and ZEKUR, three healthcare organizations. The goal was to find UX problems and choose the business that needed the greatest work. ZEKUR stood out because of a number of serious UX issues.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> Within a short timeframe, I had to examine ZEKUR's user path, pinpoint problems, and create better wireframes to showcase a more user-friendly experience.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> I identified several major issues with ZEKUR's user experience:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Fonts that were too large caused misalignment and readability issues.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">No progress bar left users unsure of their position in the process.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Complex terms lacked explanations, confusing first-time users.</li>
                    <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The poor layout made package comparison difficult.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To address these, I created a comparison table to streamline package selection, added a progress tracker, clarified terminology, and redesigned the header for easier navigation. All work was completed swiftly to meet the project deadline.</p>            
                <p>- <strong>Result:</strong>  I successfully presented wireframes that addressed ZEKUR's UX issues in spite of the deadline restrictions. The client was pleased with the enhancements and was especially pleased with the level of quality and efficiency of my work.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Reflection:</strong> The importance of quick, targeted problem-solving under pressure was highlighted by this task. It validated my capacity to produce well-considered design solutions on short notice without sacrificing too much quality. </p>

                <div class="underline"></div>
                <p>Starting with a low-fidelity structure, I created wireframes for our studio website, iterating it several times in response to color schemes, layout suggestions, and design inspiration. The finished design effectively struck a mix between a creative, inviting vibe and coding aesthetics.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Situation:</strong> Our studio required a website design that reflected our creative brand and ability to code. It was my responsibility to produce wireframes that would develop into a well-designed, appealing prototype.</p>
                <p>- <strong>Task:</strong> In order to achieve a visually appealing and helpful website design, my objective was to develop and refine wireframes while taking into account changing color schemes and input from teachers and team members. </p>
                <p>- <strong>Action:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Began with low-fidelity wireframes that concentrated on the fundamental layout and structure.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Created a bright color scheme at first, which I then changed to a darker one.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Contributed additional design and pictures to improve the mockup and took into account layout suggestions from the team.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The wireframes were modified to fit the team's color design, which was influenced by the dark theme of Visual Studio Code.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Changed to a more vivid color scheme with more dramatic images in response to teacher feedback.</li>
                        <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Green accents were added to the final version, which matched the team's decision.</li>
